## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerabilities we ask that you please responsibly disclose them. This means you should report the issue to us privately and give us enough time to issue a fix before publicly disclosing it as MemberMatters is actively used in production.

You can alert us to a security vulnerability by sending an email to infrastructure@hsbne.org. Please include as much information as possible so that we can recreate and fix it.
