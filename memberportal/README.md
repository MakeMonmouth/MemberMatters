### Getting started (Django backend)
First step is to grab a copy of this repository. You will need to make sure you have python installed,
3.7 or newer as that's the only version it has been tested on. Make sure you also install pip so that you can install
all of the dependencies.

To install python 3/pip and the requirements run these commands from within this folder:
#### Linux (Ubuntu)
 
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
#### Linux (Fedora)
```
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
 
#### macOS
You will need to install and use virtualenv on Mac in order to get your environment correct as there are conflicts with built in python on macOS.
 
```bash
brew install python3
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You should see (venv) $ at your command prompt, letting you know that youâ€™re running the proper virtualenv install. To deactivate, you can just run the following to come out of the environment.

```bash
deactivate
```

#### Windows
Please follow the instructions below to setup dev environment in Windows (tested in Windows 7 & 10).
* Download & install Python 3.6+ from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* CD into the cloned repository.
* Assuming `pip` and `virtualenv` is already installed as part of the package, execute: `py -3 -m venv venv` 
* Activate the venv by running: `venv\Scripts\activate`
* Install dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements-win.txt`
* You're all set up. Follow the instructions below to start the dev server.
 
### Running the dev server
In production, we have an nginx reverse proxy setup. For development however, it's useful to use the built in 
development server. Navigate to the memberportal folder. (`cd memberportal` on bash or cmd) First we need to make 
sure we have a local sqlite database with the correct migrations applied, and default database. 

You probably won't be able to create a log file and database in the default location. You should set a couple of 
environment variables like below to create them locally when developing:

To run the Django dev server:

```bash
PORTAL_LOG_LOCATION=errors.log PORTAL_DB_LOCATION=db.sqlite3 python3 manage.py migrate
```
 
After running that you should see something like this:
```bash
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: access, admin, auth, causes, contenttypes, profile, sessions, memberbucks
Running migrations:
  Applying causes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  ...
```

Now load some initial data into the database:
```bash
python3 manage.py loaddata fixtures/initial.json
```

If that completes with no errors run the command below to start the development server.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
Django version 2.0.7, using settings 'membermatters.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Take note of the IP and port. In this case, open your favourite browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should 
be presented with the home page of the web app. You can login with the username "default@example.com" and password 
"MemberMatters!". You should create a new account, then use the default account to give your new account admin rights. You 
should change the password of the default admin account.

#### Pre-commit hooks
Finally, you need to install the git pre-commit hooks:

`pre-commit install`

Failure to ensure your code is compliant with our code formatting and linting standards will result 
in rejection of your pull request so please make sure you complete this step.

### Contributing Guidelines
Please use best practices while contributing. This includes writing clean code (messy/hacky 
code will be rejected) and making sure it's well commented. Try to think of the next person who comes along so use 
variable names that make sense and avoid weird tricks that not everyone will understand.

Please work on existing issues (use comments to clarify/discuss things). If you want to fix undocumented 
bugs or add new things open an issue for discussion.

Once you are happy with your changes, please open a pull request to merge them into dev. Your changes will be reviewed 
and accepted/rejected.

Note to collaborators with push permission: Do not push directly to master. You should push all changes to a feature 
branch first (`feature/<feature_name>`). When you are happy with it submit a pull request for merging into dev. The 
`master` should only contain the latest stable release.

We use eslint, prettier and black for code linting and formatting. These are setup as precommit 
hooks. These are a requirement and anything that fails these rules will not be accepted. If you 
would like to suggest changes to the eslint config please open an issue. If you have a specific use 
case, you may disable eslint rules on a line by line basis. Any global disables will be rejected 
unless you have a really good reason.

### Notes
You will need to re-run the database migration every time the db models change. You may see random database related errors such as column does not exist if you forget to do this. You can do that by running:

`python3 manage.py migrate`

To test all of the features you will need some api keys. Define these as environment variables:
* PORTAL_SENDGRID_API_KEY
* PORTAL_XERO_CONSUMER_KEY
* PORTAL_XERO_RSA_FILE (path to the rsa key)
